GiveBack was an application built during a 24 hour
hackathon in which we were tasked with creating a way for 
youth to partake in volunteer opportunities near them.
As this was my group's first Hackathon, we decided to
go simple and make a mobile app that featured a list of
nearby events and allowed the user to follow and join an
event. The app was built using <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a>
and used <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>
as it's backend to save us some time.
