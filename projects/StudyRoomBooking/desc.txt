StudyRoomBooking is an application a friend and I started work on in 2019
to improve Sheridan College's study room booking service. However, exam
season came and all work on the app ceased until the following year when
we decided to completely redo the app from the ground up.  Built in 
<a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a>, the app utilizes Google's 
<a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> for quick 
prototyping and a fast querying database. Within the application, 
you can book a room in as little as two clicks, view your current 
& upcoming bookings, and share bookings with classmates so everyone 
knows when & where. Physical room locations can be outfitted with a 
simple QR code, which when scanned by the app shows all bookings for that 
room for the day. This allows students to easily check if a room has 
a booking starting soon.
